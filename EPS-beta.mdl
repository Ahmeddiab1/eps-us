	~	Unlike the intensities of other pollutants, carbon intensity depends \
		almost entirely on the fuel and not on the technology burning it.  \
		Accordingly, we use the value from one particular sector to represent the \
		carbon intensity of a given fuel, even if that fuel is used in more than \
		one sector.  (For example, we use the carbon intensity of coal in the \
		electricity sector to represent the carbon intensity of coal, even though \
		coal is also used in the industry and buildings sectors.)  Similarly, we \
		always use LDVs when calculating carbon intensities of fuels used in the \
		Transportation sector.

	~	We assign zero flexibility points to non-wind, non-solar sources because \

		assign flexibility points first to the "newly built" quality level, then \
		to the "preexisting nonretiring" quality level, and finally to the \
		"preexisting retiring" quality level.  This is so that if not all the wind \

		(since it is presumably the best economic deal to dispatch the newest wind \
		and solar, and there is a larger chance it wouldn't have been built if it \
		couldn't be dispatched in the current year).  This helps ensure the \
		compatibility of the flexibility point restriction with the least-cost \
		dispatch mechanism.  As noted above, we allow each flexibility point to \
		apply to BOTH wind and solar, since they need backup during different \
		times of day.  In contrast, we do not allow each flexibility point to \
		apply to multiple quality levels of the same plant type, since they will \

		in the resulting total allocated quantity, an error less than 0.0005%.)  \
		To avoid letting this error show up as non-zero values for Unmet \
		Electricity Demand, we use the QUANTUM function to round-toward-zero to \
		the nearest 10000 MWh (allowing for errors on the order of 0.001%).  This \
		will likely not show up when there is a real value for unmet electricity \
		demand, because the real value is likely to be so large (e.g. >1%) that \
		the reduction due to the QUANTUM function will not be visible given the \
		number of decimal places displayed by Vensim.

Power Plant Quality:
	preexisting retiring,

	newly built
	~	
	~	Each of these three quality levels is the average plant of its type.  For \
		example, natural gas plants built during the model run may be more and \
		more efficient if they are built in later and later years.  The properties \
		of the average natural gas plant built during the model run define the \
		properties of the "newly built" quality level for natural gas plants.  \
		This may be a weighted average of different underlying technologies, like \
		combined cycle, combustion turbine, etc.  This may have the effect of \
		overstating the performance of plants built early in the model run and \
		understating the performance of plants built late in the model run, but it \
		is more feasible from a model standpoint than tracking each annual cohort \
		of power plants individually (with its own set of values for each input \
		variable that defines its properties).

		spikes that unrealistically affect the price of electricity, because the \
		costs of construction of new generation assets really would be spread out \
		over a few years.  We use an initial value of zero (and SMOOTHI rather \
		than SMOOTH) because prior to the start of the model run, the change in \
		construction costs due to policies is zero (none were in effect).  If we \
		do not, then the first year has a strongly negative change in construction \
		cost that then affects all the prices down the line and pulls them down in \
		an unrealistic way.  The curve with an initial value of zero is much \
		closer to the original (unsmoothed) curve than SMOOTH with no initial \
		value.

		determined via a computer model based on a carbon tax, so leakage can be \
		negative if a foreign firm has a lower carbon intensity than a U.S. firm \
		when producing a particular good (this is the case for natural gas and \
		coal), or if imports to the U.S. are reduced (this is the case for oil).

LDVs Feebate Rate=
	0 {LDVs}
	~	$/(hundredth gal/mile) [0,1500]
	~	At first glance, a feebate rate of $500/.01 gpm may sound very large.  However, this \
		feebate rate equates to a $500 fee on an LDV that gets 20 mpg if the pivot \
		point is 25 mpg.  (To see this: 20 mpg is 0.04 gpm.  25 mpg is 0.05 gpm.  \
		The difference is -.01 gpm.  So in order to levy a $500 fee on the 20 mpg \
		car when the pivot point is 25 mpg, we need a rate of $500/.01 gpm.)  The \
		feebate rate is designated in gpm rather than mpg because this provides \
		the same monetary incentive to save a gallon of fuel for all LDVs, despite \
		their different efficiencies.  That is, given a fixed number of miles \
		driven, reducing gpm by 0.01 will save the same quantity of fuel for any \
		car.  Given a fixed number of miles driven, increasing mpg by 0.01 will \
		save different amounts of fuel in different cars, depending on their \
		starting efficiencies.
		
		We're assuming the pivot point is adjusted to always maintain revenue \
		neutrality (no net cost to government or consumers).  This policy lever \
		only applies to LDVs due to a lack of data on feebate effects on other \
		vehicle types.

		planning, promoting telework and information-based travel substitutes, \
		parking supply and pricing policies, roadway/congestion pricing, improving \
		bus transit, and encouraging non-motorized transit such as biking and \
		walking.  The IEA indicates that while they modeled year 2050, nearly the \
		same results could be achieved by 2030 with rapid implementation of these \
		policies, so we use the BLUE Shifts scenario to represent the maximum \
		potential for TDM intervention by this model's end year (e.g. with this \
		variable set to 1).  We assume the policy phases in linearly across the \
		model run.  Source:

(1) We have BAU future projections of fleetwide fuel use by fuel type, but not for vehicles sold in any given year.  We would need this (or an ALLOCATE function with pricing assumptions, etc.) to allocate new Cargo Dist Transported among fuel types.  This is further complicated by the fact that some vehicles are not locked into a fuel type at time of purchase but can use varying amounts of petroleum or biofuels.

(3) We would need BAU New Vehicle Fuel Economy data disaggregated by fuel type (or in the case of LDVs and HDVs, fuel standard data disaggregated by fuel type), as well as Historical Fuel Economy (or Energy Intensity) data disaggregated by fuel type.  These are not available, and an assumption likely introduces at least as much inaccuracy as the current approach.

New Vehicle Fuel Economy (tracked in lumped energy units) is based on the most typical fuel type or mix for each vehicle type (from the EIA source data or the units in which LDV fuel economy standards are written).  Electricity has much greater efficiency in BTU per unit cargo*dist, so we need to adjust the fuel usage.

In a single year, no single generation technology may grow more than a specified percentage of its own value the prior year, and no more than would cause its single-year growth to exceed a fixed percentage of total (not new) U.S. electricity capacity.  The latter percentage is based on historical observed capacity growth and is adjusted for capacity factors of different generation types.

A "flexibility point" is a quantity of flexibility on the grid (provided by any combination of dispatchable generation, storage, and demand response) that enables the grid to support BOTH one MW of wind and one MW of solar.  We allow each flexibility point to support both generation types because wind and solar tend to be in need of support/backup at different times of the day and so can use the same flexibility resources.

The Mandated Capacity Construction policy can cause solar or wind capacity to be built in excess of what can be supported by flexibility points.  This extra capacity will (correctly) not be dispatched, since we check against flexibility point availability in the dispatch calculations.

Capacity constructed during the model run does not retire during the model run (unless forced to do so by the Early Retirement Policy or high variable expenses, if all older generation has already retired) because the model run period (18 years) is shorter than the lifetime of the shortest-lived generation types (20 years).

The RPS ensures enough potential electricity output from RPS-qualifying sources is available in 2030 (with a linear policy phase-in before then).  The RPS does not explicitly affect dispatch, because the contract-based dispatch ought to take priority (and if high enough, is allowed to violate the RPS), and thereafter, the renewables ought to be dispatched first under least cost dispatch anyway, due to their low marginal cost of operaiton.

Policy-mandated capacity that is built in excess of the amount that can be supported by flexibility points will not be dispatched (handled below) and accordingly is not counted here when determining how much new capacity is needed in order to meet demand.

We don't know what the newly served floor area is (in any given year), but we don't have to, because we know it's the same in the BAU and Policy cases.  (Even past component lifetime, once we're retiring different amounts of energy in the BAU and Policy cases, they represent the same floor areas, because the difference is due to efficiency changes.)

This feedback reflects the tendency to buy equipment with greater efficiency when fuel prices are higher.  The tendency to consume less building services in order to save energy when energy prices are higher is handled below (and applies to all building components, not just new ones).

We track cumulative energy difference relative to BAU, rather than tracking cumulative energy use (in the policy case), because this enables us to avoid making an assumption about the retirement rate of preexisting components at model start here.  (We still use such an assumption to help us estimate the fraction of component energy use that is new each year.)

Note that the "heating" building component refers to heating of air.  Water heaters are part of the "appliances" component in this model, as they are unaffected by the building envelope, whereas the "envelope" component influences the energy use of "heating" and "cooling and ventilation" components.

We must convert to fuel use, not keep these as percent changes in fuel use, because if we use percent changes, (1) coal conversion doesn't work if a recipient fuel type for an industry is zero in the BAU case, and (2) we have trouble summing across policies in the Industrial Fuel Use variable.

The structure above calculates the change in cash flow for each actor as a result of changes in fuel consumption brought about by the various industrial policies (and R&D).  That doesn't account for change in cash flow due to differences in the pre-tax cost or tax rate of baseline fuel consumption, so we need the structure below to handle that.  We add the results together to get total changes in cash flow.

Except for electricity, BAU costs in this input variable should incorporate both taxes and BAU subsidies (many of which are upstream, such as those pertaining to drilling or mining, and are certainly incorporated in reported fuel prices).  For electricity, only taxes should be incorporated, as BAU subsidies paid to electricity producers are handled elsewhere on this page.

We must separate the fuel used and fuel cost for CCS by sector into two variables here (rather than using the CCS Sectors subscript) because they use fuel types that are in different subscripts (Electricity Source and Industrial Fuel), and Vensim won't allow you to use different subscripts in different equations within the same variable.

We estimate the effect of user-set policies collectively on the economy-wide emissions intensity here.  We use regular rather than "after GDP Adjustment" total to avoid the need for a SIMULTANEOUS directive, which works here but is fragile to changes in input data and model structure.  It makes little difference to the numerical results.

We generally don't use the "after GDP adjustment" versions of emissions variables, because the GDP adjustment only accounts for changes in energy prices, not the whole range of impacts the policies might have on GDP.  We mostly include this structure in case of future model extensions that may refine the Change in GDP calculation, making the "after GDP Adjustment" variables more meaningful.

This is the sum of increases and reductions in what is spent on goods, services, labor, etc.  It excludes the cash flow impacts on the cash recipients (the sellers of those things).  For example, if Industry spends more on worker training (sending cash to Consumers), this will be represented as a negative cash flow for Industry and zero cash flow for Consumers.

This metric is designed to provide a sense of whether policies increase or decrease overall spending on fuel, energy-related equipment, labor, etc. (at a given level of demand for products).  Funds not spent on these things might be available for other purposes, such as expanding one's business, performing R&D, lowering taxes, etc.

Change in outlays for the six specific industries aside from the electricity sector are included in the Industry total.  Only the specific (sales) impacts are broken out, and those are changes in income rather than outlays.  Accordingly, the total here includes changes in outlays for all economic actors in the model.
