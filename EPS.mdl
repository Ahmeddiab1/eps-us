	~	Each Nonenergy Industry ISIC Code receives revenue from (#1) the carbon \
		tax rebate to the matching industry, (#2) the matching industry's revenues \
		from selling non-energy products to any/all cash flow entities, and (#3) a \
		weighted share of the revenues from products sold by the "nonenergy \
		industries" cash flow entity as inputs to any/all industries.  For #3, we \
		use an output-weighted share because we don't know what types of goods \
		were supplied by the "nonenergy industries" (e.g. steel, agricultural \
		products, machinery, etc.), though we do know that the products being \
		supplied are non-energy products (as the "nonenergy industries" actor only \
		supplies nonenergy products).  For ISIC codes with no matching "Industry \
		Category" (those in the "Other Industries Category ISIC Code" subscript), \
		we just assign output-weighted shares of #1 and #3 above (as #2 is only \
		applicable to ISIC codes that have a matching industry).  ISIC 28 \
		(machinery) has no matching industry category, so it functions like the \
		other industries in the "Other Industries Category ISIC Code" subscript \
		with one exception: we assign all revenues associated with capital \
		equipment sales that were directly induced by the policy package to this \
		ISIC code.  For ISIC 35T39, the matching industry is "waste management" \
		for purposes of #1 and #2, but this ISIC code is technically for an Energy \
		Industry ISIC Code ("Electricity, gas, water supply, sewerage, waste and \
		remediation services"), so it does not get a contribution from #3.

	~	These equations are complicated because we need to apply an efficiency \
		adjustment when fuels shift between electricity and a non-electricity \
		fuel.  We first remove all the fuels that are being shifted (including \
		some that may be staying the same), then we add in all the fuels \
		reallocated to their target fuel types.  When the target fuel is \
		electricity, we apply an efficiency adjustment to all of the added fuels, \
		and then we undo the adjustment for electricitiy that was "shifted" to \
		electricity (i.e. stayed the same).  When the target fuel is not \
		electricity, we add all of the fuels without an efficiency adjustment, and \
		then we add additional fuel to the target fuel if the source fuel was \
		electricity to make the efficiency adjustment.  If you are having trouble \
		understanding these equations, first make sure you understand the simpler \
		examples of fuel shifting code that don't involve electricity efficiency \
		adjustments, which can be found in the calculated variables immediately \
		downstream of the following two input variables: hydgn/RHPF and indst/RIFF.

	~	All reductions of non-CO2 process emissions come from the EPA source.  We \
		have grouped technical measures from the EPA document (when building the \
		MAC curve tables) so that each table only refers to abatement potential of \
		a single pollutant, except for "agriculture."  Therefore, in this \
		variable, we assign the reductions from the EPA MAC tables to the \
		corresponding pollutants.  For agriculture, we assign the reductions \
		proportinately to BAU process emissions shares by gas, excluding CO2 (in \
		line with the EPA source).  We don't currently have a policy that reduces \
		process emissions from "other industries," but in case we do in the \
		future, we assign these reductions proportionate to BAU process emissions \
		shares across all gases, including CO2.  For cement and iron and steel, \
		all process emissions (and therefore all reduction potential) are CO2.

		about converting back to "g pollutant" and then to "g CO2e" at a \
		user-selected GWP timeframe.

	~	These equations are complicated because we need to apply an efficiency \
		adjustment when fuels shift between electricity and a non-electricity \
		fuel.  We first remove all the fuels that are being shifted (including \
		some that may be staying the same), then we add in all the fuels \
		reallocated to their target fuel types.  When the target fuel is \
		electricity, we apply an efficiency adjustment to all of the added fuels, \
		and then we undo the adjustment for electricitiy that was "shifted" to \
		electricity (i.e. stayed the same).  When the target fuel is not \
		electricity, we add all of the fuels without an efficiency adjustment, and \
		then we add additional fuel to the target fuel if the source fuel was \
		electricity to make the efficiency adjustment.  If you are having trouble \
		understanding these equations, first make sure you understand the simpler \
		examples of fuel shifting code that don't involve electricity efficiency \
		adjustments, which can be found in the calculated variables immediately \
		downstream of the following two input variables: hydgn/RHPF and indst/RIFF.

		to electricity.  Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \

		concrete or steel in buildings, (2) requirements for improved durability \
		or longevity of products, so they are replaced less often, (3) more re-use \
		of products or intensification of use, such as more car sharing instead of \
		people owning their own cars, (4) water efficiency or waste reduction, \
		etc.  As of 1.5.0, the policy assumes demand from all purchasers \
		(government,industry, consumers, and foreign entities) is reduced \
		proportionately to the amount of goods they buy, and it does not have any \
		implementation cost for the policy itself, beyond the financial \
		consequences of the demand reduction.  A demand reduction for energy \
		industries specified here won't be reflected in the modeled energy-using \
		sectors (and this lever can't be set to only affect exported energy), so \
		this policy lever should not be used for energy industries within industry \
		category.  A separate lever handles shifting agricultural demand from \
		animal products to non-animal products.

		more efficient if they are built in later and later years.  The properties \
		of the average natural gas plant built during the model run define the \
		properties of the "newly built" quality level for natural gas plants.  \
		This may be a weighted average of different underlying technologies, like \
		combined cycle, combustion turbine, etc.  This may have the effect of \
		overstating the performance of plants built early in the model run and \
		understating the performance of plants built late in the model run, but it \
		is more feasible from a model standpoint than tracking each annual cohort \
		of power plants individually (with its own set of values for each input \
		variable that defines its properties).

LDVs Feebate Rate=
	0 {passenger LDVs, except battery electric passenger LDVs}
	~	Dmnl [0,1]
	~	The feebate is set as a fraction of the global best practice feebate rate.  The \
		global best practice feebate rate is $2000 per (hundredth gal/mile), which \
		equates to a $2000 fee on an LDV that gets 20 mpg if the pivot point is 25 \
		mpg.  (To see this: 20 mpg is 0.04 gpm.  25 mpg is 0.05 gpm.  The \
		difference is -.01 gpm.  So in order to levy a $2000 fee on the 20 mpg car \
		when the pivot point is 25 mpg, we need a rate of $2000/.01 gpm.)  The \
		feebate rate is designated in gpm rather than mpg because this provides \
		the same monetary incentive to save a gallon of fuel for all LDVs, despite \
		their different efficiencies.  That is, given a fixed number of miles \
		driven, reducing gpm by 0.01 will save the same quantity of fuel for any \
		car.  Given a fixed number of miles driven, increasing mpg by 0.01 will \
		save different amounts of fuel in different cars, depending on their \
		starting efficiencies.
		
		We're assuming the pivot point is adjusted to always maintain revenue \
		neutrality (no net cost to government or consumers).  This policy lever \
		only applies to passenger LDVs due to a lack of data on feebate effects on \
		other vehicle types.  The policy does not increase the efficiency of \
		battery electric LDVs, as it is assumed that they are already sufficiently \
		fuel-efficient to receive any potential benefits of the feebate, so the \
		feebate would not incentivize further fuel efficiency improvements in this \
		type of LDV.

	~	MW*hour/BTU
	~	This variable is used in several places in the model where a direct unit \
		conversion (not a change of energy carrier) is needed.  It converts \
		between 1 BTU of electricity and 1 MWh of electricity.  Since this is a \
		strict unit conversion, there is no efficiency loss, and this value \
		applies globally (to all countries that may be modeled).

		improved labeling.  The labeling influences consumers who are buying \
		appliances of all Quality levels, so it's represented as a simple \
		percentage increase in the efficiency of components sold (at all quality \
		levels).  (If Quality Levels are defined based on particular efficiency \
		thresholds, this may mean the number of square feet served by components \
		of a given quality level will not be accurate, but the end result in terms \
		of energy use will still be accurate.  It's just a question of the meaning \
		of the labels we give to each Quality level.)

The LCFS calculation (and policy lever setting) refer only to the fuel used by regulated vehicle types (as specified by the model adapter in an input variable), after adjustment for the efficiency of use of electricity.  Hence, we calculate the various LCFS metrics here, as the ratio of carbon free energy to all energy that meets these two conditions.

Carbon Free Energy (CFE) refers to the decarbonized portion of the energy from natural gas and biofuels (relative to the reference fuels gasoline or diesel) and all electricity used as a transport fuel (irrespective of how the electricity was produced).

SoCDTtiNTY values for each vehicle/cargo type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Transportation Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCDTtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Vehicles" at the years corresponding to vehicle lifetimes.

We estimate start year fuel use (that is, one year before the first simulated year) by calculating it using data from the first simulated year.  This saves us the burden of calculating it in Excel and providing it as input data, and it prevents discontinuities as the model switches over from the provided value to a value calculated from the properties of the fleet.

To calibrate a vehicle type with a lifetime longer than the model run, such as rail, temporarily extend the model run by changing FINAL TIME to a farther-out value, such as 2060.  Perform the calibration, then restore FINAL TIME to its former value (2050).

Separately-regulated pollutants are non-CO2 combustion byproducts whose emissions are limited by law, such as a limit on NOx emissions per kilometer.  Improving fuel efficiency causes less fuel to be burned per kilometer, but it may not reduce emissions of NOx per kilometer.  Vehicle manufacturers design vehicles to meet fuel economy and conventional pollutant standards separately and may narrowly comply with each standard.  So, if fuel economy improves, the vehicle manufacturer may allow more NOx to be emitted per gram of gasoline burned, to keep the NOx rate per kilometer just under the standard.  We assume that separately-regulated pollutants are unaffected by changes in fuel economy, while other pollutants increase or decrease in proportion to changes in fuel economy.

All changes in revenue and expenditures here should be due to changes in domestic vehicles.  Changes in revenue or expenditure from selling vehicles for export is handled in the Industry sector, where vehicle suppliers are lumped into the "other industries" category.  For this reason, FoVObE should assign no vehicles to Foreign Entities.

Fuel efficiency improvements for CCS due to R&D are accounted for on the CCS page, so we do not need to modify these intensities via R&D on this page (as we do when calculating the emissions intensity of the fuels burned to generate electricity).

A "flexibility point" is a quantity of flexibility on the grid (provided by any combination of dispatchable generation, storage, and demand response) that enables the grid to support BOTH one MW of wind and one MW of solar.  We allow each flexibility point to support both generation types because wind and solar tend to be in need of support/backup at different times of the day and so can use the same flexibility resources.

The RPS ensures enough potential electricity output from RPS-qualifying sources is available.  The RPS does not explicitly affect dispatch, because the contract-based dispatch ought to take priority (and if high enough, is allowed to violate the RPS), and thereafter, the renewables ought to be dispatched first under least cost dispatch anyway, due to their low marginal cost

Policy-mandated new capacity is not subject to the build limits, but any capacity built under this policy does subtract from the amount that can be built apart from this policy (to a minimum of zero).

We assume that quality level has no effect on whether a plant is dispatched under guaranteed dispatch, so each quality level is dispatched in propotion to its commonality.

Since Vensim's ALLOCATE AVAILABLE function can only allocate across elements of a single subscript, we need to move our eleven power plant types and three quality levels into a single 33-element subscript prior to the allocation, then move them back into their respective subscripts after the allocation.

Electricity suppliers approach whichever future-year RPS target produces the highest slope in the current year, so as to minimize the slope of increases in future years.  (This method produces the lowest maximum slope, minimizing the shock to electricity producers.)

If all such slopes are negative (i.e. all future RPS targets are below the surviving RPS-qualifying percentage), the minimum RPS-qualifying percentage sought will drop over time, but this will not matter, as no significant amount of RPS-qualifying resources are likely to retire during the model run.

All support services (demand response, grid batteries, electric vehicles, and transmission capacity across the modeled region border) that can support the grid in one part of the modeled region may not be able to support the grid in a different part of the modeled region, subject to transmission constraints.  Hence, the available peak reduction services from all of these resources are limited by the transmission connectivity coefficient.

When determining the share of demand that can be met from surviving RPS-qualifying sources, we use the surviving sources' expected electricity output, which is based on their expected capacity factors.  We can't use their actual output this year because dispatch calculations are handled later in the calculation flow.  If the model thinks the RPS is satisfied but is not dispatching enough RPS-qualifying sources to meet the RPS, either adjust the expected capacity factors of RPS-qualifying sources, or adjust the dispatch settings (such as eliminating guaranteed dispatch for fossil plants that may crowd out RE).

Decommissioning costs for power plants are calculated (see the Electricity Supply - Cash Flow tab), but they are intentionally excluded from the calculation that determines what plant types to build, reflecting the fact that real-world utilities disregard these decades-distant, end-of-life costs when choosing what new plant types to build.

We calculate potential capacity retirements based on whether the dispatch cost of those plant types rises relative to the mean, relative to the BAU case.  This causes retirements of technologies like coal or natural gas as the mean cost of production declines, as more renewables come onto the system.

In any given year, we do not allow the model to retire in total (across plant types) more capacity than it could build in total (across plant types, excluding plant types that are more expensive to dispatch relative to the mean plant under the policy package than in BAU).

We disallow early economic retirement of technologies whose cost is below the average in the current year, even if they are farther below the mean price in the BAU case than they are in the policy case.  (This prevents a situation where the mean declines because lots of cheap renewables go on the grid, causing cheap sources like solar or wind to retire because they are becoming less-cheap relative to the mean in the policy case than they were in the BAU case.)

We assume embedded (i.e. non-fuel) emissions are upstream energy-related CO2, and thus is not affected by the control levers governing whether the carbon tax applies to process emissions or non-CO2 gases.

This page calculates changes in cash flows due to spending by the electricity sector, including on constructing new generation, buying fuel, OM, building transmission, etc.  It also calculates changes in electricity prices, for use on the "Fuels" sheet.  This sheet does not calculate cash flow impacts of changes in electricity sales, because those are handled on the cash flow pages of the various electricity-demanding sectors.

In this case, electricity suppliers are paying other electricity suppliers, so we don't recognize cash flow changes by entity.  (Broken-out industries are not restricted to the modeled region's borders.)  We do add the Change in Amount Spend on Importing Electricity to the Change in Total Outlays and Change in Capital Labor and Fuel Expenditures metrics, however.

Note that the "heating" building component refers to heating of air.  Water heaters are part of the "appliances" component in this model, as they are unaffected by the building envelope, whereas the "envelope" component influences the energy use of "heating" and "cooling and ventilation" components.

In order to compare the cost of running building components that serve the same buildings with the same fuel, we need to calculate a hypothetical energy use quantity in the BAU case, if the fuel shifting policy (and no other policy) had applied to that case.  Otherwise, we see large increases in cost per unit services for components using the target fuel (most commonly electricity) and large drops for other components, which is wrong, as it would be interpreting a fuel shift as fuel increases and decreases at the same service levels.

SoCEUtiNTY values for each component/building type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Buildings Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCEUtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Components Potential Energy Use Summed Across Fuels" at the years corresponding to component lifetimes.

Although this variable is not used in calculations on this sheet, it is used in calculations on other sheets, and it relies on an input data file (BDEQ) used for another variable on this sheet, so this variable must be placed here.

Note that for greater accuracy, it would be necessary to know how many years early components are replaced due to retrofitting, then to subtract out the energy use of the replaced components BOTH from new and from retiring components energy use in that year, because the component isn't being replaced in that year anymore, as it was replaced earlier.  In practice, these subtractions largely cancel each other out, and it's hard to find data on the number of years early that components would be replaced, so we simplify by not including this interaction.

Exogenous GDP energy use adjustment is introduced after the correction factor to avoid throwing off the correction factor calculations.  It effectively reduces energy use but not the purchase of new building components, similar to the effect of price-demand feedbacks.

Since input BCEU data may not be perfectly in sync with input lifetime (CL) data, to make our calculated BAU case components energy use match the input data, we use a correction factor.  The correction factor is calculated in Vensim and should be small if your BCEU and CL data are accurate and well-aligned with each other.  Larger discrepencies between data in BCEU and CL will result in a larger correction factor.

We prevent reductions in crude oil feedstock use when the demand reduction for NGPS industry products is due to reduced demand for natural gas (which doesn't use crude oil as a feedstock).  The one-year delay here both is needed to avoid circularity and aligns these calculations to the same year as the reduced production, where there is also a one-year delay.

When industrial production declines as a result of a policy package, this creates two types of first-order cash flows.  First, industry sells fewer goods, receiving less revenue.  Second, industry buys fewer inputs, so other entities receive less cash (and industry saves some).  This structure tracks both of these cash flows.

We only calculate cash flows for changes in non-energy inputs here, because changes in energy inputs (e.g. changes in fuel and electricity purchases by industries) are handled elsewhere on this sheet (under the header "Cash Flow Changes from Fuel Use and Taxes Affecting Fuel").

Cash flow changes from changes in energy sales are already handled in each demand sector (and on the Fuels page for changes in net fuel exports), so the change in cash flow due to changes in industrial outputs from energy supplying industries is not included (is zero) here, to avoid double counting.

For cash flow entities that have matching industry categories (two energy industries), we use EPS-calculated revenue (with a delay to avoid circularity) rather than taking revenue from input data.

Since energy industries' spending on nonenergy inputs doesn't affect their revenue (it affects the revenue of nonenergy industries), it is technically possible to avoid the need to introduce this delay.  Getting around Vensim's circularity checks would require excluding nonenergy industries from the subscript of the revenue total variable used here.  That could be done by constructing a second, duplicative total revenue calculation, only including the energy industries.  This would require a lot of additional, duplicative model structure across all sectors, which is not worthwhile, either in development time, or in its impacts on model understandability.  The one-timestep delay is the better solution in this case.

We annualize abatement from avoidance of large one-time carbon releases (deforestation, peat fires) over the time required for the forest or peatland to regenerate after a major carbon release.  This avoids unrealistic, spiky results and also allows the associated policies to be treated in a way consistent with other land use sector policies (except improved forest management).

We must include a one-step delay before calculating costs and fuel use to power CCS, as electricity is one of the fuels that can power CCS (in the Industry sector), and this influences electricity demand, which influences "Electricity Sector Pollutant Emissions before CCS," used here to help calculate sequestration from electric sector generation types.  (Note that Vensim incorrectly fails to generate a "Simultaneous Equation" error in the Policy (non-BAU) version of this loop, but it is actually circular in both the BAU and non-BAU structures.)

Changes in crude exports due to changes in secondary production should not be apportioned into changes in crude production or crude imports, because the crude that was formerly being used to make secondary products is now being exported instead.  Therefore, we subtract out any change in crude exports due to changes in secondary production.

Revenue for fuel, equipment, or labor provided to the modeled region's sectors (transportation, electricity, buildings, industry, district heat, hydrogen, etc.) is not export revenue, as the sectors represent activitiy within the modeled region.  Changes in export revenue in the EPS only come from the industry sector (where more or fewer non-energy goods can be sold to foreign entities) and in the fuels sector (where more or fewer fuels and electricity can be exported).

"Requirements" variables refer to the number of jobs, amount of added value, or earnings in each industry that is required to produce a particular level of output by a particular industry.  If you have a known change in output level of a particular industry (e.g. caused by policy, elsewhere in the EPS), you can multiply this by a requirements variable to determine how many jobs, added value, or earnings were required (created) in order to provide that incremental output.

Here, we account for the economic activity generated by changes in spending by government and by households (labor and consumers).  If we had domestic policies that influenced foreign spending on non-fuel industrial goods, that change in spending would need to be factored in here also.  (Changes in fuel exports are already accounted for in change in domestic fuel production.)

The "Domestic" version of the Leontief Inverse Matrix filters out spending spent on foreign goods/services insofar as respending and cash flows between ISIC codes.  It expects an input that is the direct change in output for domestic ISIC codes (that is, it won't reduce the direct changes in output it receives to eliminate a foreign share), so we must do that as a separate step here.  Conversely, the "Total" version of the Leontief Inverse Matrix does not filter respending flows and requires a total (not just domestic) change in output as its input.

Theoretically, the sum of Value Added across the economy (e.g. across all ISIC codes) is equal to GDP.  But "BAU Value Added by ISIC Code" is based on a single, historical year (and many countries/regions have their own BAU GDP estimates they prefer), so we rely on time series input data for BAU GDP and only use our value added numbers to apportion BAU GDP and GDP by ISIC Code.

In the demand sectors' energy demand feedback loops, we want to feed back in the percent change in demand caused by the indirect effects of the policy package (as the direct effects are already included in each of these sectors).

All the changes in government and household spending on this sheet will cause indirect effects (as the direct effects of policies on spending, like a government subsidy to utilities or an efficiency policy reducing the amount of fuel households buy, are already accounted for in the sectors.)

Changes in industries' cash flows coming into this sheet (from "Change in Cash Flow by Entity" for the energy industries and from "Change in Nonenergy Industry Cash Flow by ISIC Code" for non-energy industries) are direct results of the policy package, not indirect.  But changes in spending by one ISIC code causes indirect effects on other industries.

Therefore, we use a modified version of the Domestic Leontief Inverse Matrix that excludes direct (same-industry) impacts for the industry contribution to change in output, while using the standard Domestic Leontief Inverse Matrix for household and government spending.

We don't know what ISIC codes in foreign nations received the "foreign entities" cash flow changes, so we allocate it to foreign industries in the same proportions as cash flow changes are allocated to domestic industries by the industry sector (as the industry sector, not government or households, will be the most important buyer of foreign products).  This is very rough (in reality, domestic and foreign industries likely specialize in different products), but it's better than omitting the foreign entities' direct cash flow change entirely.

Carbon taxes are levied upstream on fuel sales, before it is known whether a unit of fuel will be burned with or without CCS.  So the government must pay CCS providers back for the tax they already paid (capitalized into the cost of their fuels).  Also, CCS providers might sell their CCS services on a market for credits.  So carbon tax rebates are distinct rebate payments (which we classify as subsidies), not a reduction in tax.
