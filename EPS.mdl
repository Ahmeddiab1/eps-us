	~	All reductions of non-CO2 process emissions come from the EPA source.  We \
		have grouped technical measures from the EPA document (when building the \
		MAC curve tables) so that each table only refers to abatement potential of \
		a single pollutant, except for "agriculture."  Therefore, in this \
		variable, we assign the reductions from the EPA MAC tables to the \
		corresponding pollutants.  For agriculture, we assign the reductions \
		proportinately to BAU process emissions shares by gas, excluding CO2 (in \
		line with the EPA source).  We don't currently have a policy that reduces \
		process emissions from "other industries," but in case we do in the \
		future, we assign these reductions proportionate to BAU process emissions \
		shares across all gases, including CO2.  For cement and iron and steel, \
		all process emissions (and therefore all reduction potential) are CO2.

	~	Each Nonenergy Industry ISIC Code receives revenue from (#1) the carbon \
		tax rebate to the matching industry, (#2) the matching industry's revenues \
		from selling non-energy products to any/all cash flow entities, and (#3) a \
		weighted share of the revenues from products sold by the "nonenergy \
		industries" cash flow entity as inputs to any/all industries.  For #3, we \
		use an output-weighted share because we don't know what types of goods \
		were supplied by the "nonenergy industries" (e.g. steel, agricultural \
		products, machinery, etc.), though we do know that the products being \
		supplied are non-energy products (as the "nonenergy industries" actor only \
		supplies nonenergy products).  For ISIC codes with no matching "Industry \
		Category" (those in the "Other Industries Category ISIC Code" subscript), \
		we just assign output-weighted shares of #1 and #3 above (as #2 is only \
		applicable to ISIC codes that have a matching industry).  ISIC 28 \
		(machinery) has no matching industry category, so it functions like the \
		other industries in the "Other Industries Category ISIC Code" subscript \
		with one exception: we assign all revenues associated with capital \
		equipment sales that were directly induced by the policy package to this \
		ISIC code.  For ISIC 35T39, the matching industry is "waste management" \
		for purposes of #1 and #2, but this ISIC code is technically for an Energy \
		Industry ISIC Code ("Electricity, gas, water supply, sewerage, waste and \
		remediation services"), so it does not get a contribution from #3.

	~	These equations are complicated because we need to apply an efficiency \
		adjustment when fuels shift between electricity and a non-electricity \
		fuel.  We first remove all the fuels that are being shifted (including \
		some that may be staying the same), then we add in all the fuels \
		reallocated to their target fuel types.  When the target fuel is \
		electricity, we apply an efficiency adjustment to all of the added fuels, \
		and then we undo the adjustment for electricitiy that was "shifted" to \
		electricity (i.e. stayed the same).  When the target fuel is not \
		electricity, we add all of the fuels without an efficiency adjustment, and \
		then we add additional fuel to the target fuel if the source fuel was \
		electricity to make the efficiency adjustment.  If you are having trouble \
		understanding these equations, first make sure you understand the simpler \
		examples of fuel shifting code that don't involve electricity efficiency \
		adjustments, which can be found in the calculated variables immediately \
		downstream of the following two input variables: hydgn/RHPF and indst/RIFF.

		20-year or 100-year GWP values) because we must use the same timeframe as \
		our source document which provides marginal abatement curves in units of \
		100-year GWP CO2e.  We later convert to cash flow (using marginal cost \
		definitions that assume 100-year GWP values), so we don't have to worry \
		about converting back to "g pollutant" and then to "g CO2e" at a \
		user-selected GWP timeframe.

	~	These equations are complicated because we need to apply an efficiency \
		adjustment when fuels shift between electricity and a non-electricity \
		fuel.  We first remove all the fuels that are being shifted (including \
		some that may be staying the same), then we add in all the fuels \
		reallocated to their target fuel types.  When the target fuel is \
		electricity, we apply an efficiency adjustment to all of the added fuels, \
		and then we undo the adjustment for electricitiy that was "shifted" to \
		electricity (i.e. stayed the same).  When the target fuel is not \
		electricity, we add all of the fuels without an efficiency adjustment, and \
		then we add additional fuel to the target fuel if the source fuel was \
		electricity to make the efficiency adjustment.  If you are having trouble \
		understanding these equations, first make sure you understand the simpler \
		examples of fuel shifting code that don't involve electricity efficiency \
		adjustments, which can be found in the calculated variables immediately \
		downstream of the following two input variables: hydgn/RHPF and indst/RIFF.

	~	Plug-in hybrids can shift to either electricity or biofuels.  To model \

		possible shifts (petroleum gasoline to biofuel gasoline, petroleum \
		gasoline to electricity, and biofuel gasoline to electricity).  In \
		practice, biofuel gasoline is hardly used by plug-in hybrids, and \
		electricity will always be the more economical choice for satisfying an \
		LCFS via generation of carbon-free energy.  Therefore, we only allow for \
		one of these three types of shifts in plug-in hybrids: petroleum gasoline \
		to electricity.  Accordingly, we must subtract out the (small) quantity by \
		which biofuels could be increased in plug-in hybrids when calculating the \
		total amount of potential increase in biofuels, to avoid exceeding the \
		maximum allowable shift in gasoline or diesel vehicles (when the shift is \
		assigned to those vehicles, rather than to plug-in hybrids, later in the \

	~	This policy represents a reduction in demand for non-energy, \
		non-agriculture industrial outputs.  It can be used to represent policies \
		such as (1) material-efficient building codes reducing the amount of \
		concrete or steel in buildings, (2) requirements for improved durability \
		or longevity of products, so they are replaced less often, (3) more re-use \
		of products or intensification of use, such as more car sharing instead of \
		people owning their own cars, (4) water efficiency or waste reduction, \
		etc.  As of 1.5.0, the policy assumes demand from all purchasers \
		(government,industry, consumers, and foreign entities) is reduced \
		proportionately to the amount of goods they buy, and it does not have any \
		implementation cost for the policy itself, beyond the financial \
		consequences of the demand reduction.  A demand reduction for energy \
		industries specified here won't be reflected in the modeled energy-using \
		sectors (and this lever can't be set to only affect exported energy), so \
		this policy lever should not be used for energy industries within industry \
		category.  A separate lever handles shifting agricultural demand from \
		animal products to non-animal products.

		with one of the electricity sources that doesn't require flexibility \
		points, so we shouldn't curtail it.  (2) We use a MAX(0) because we cannot \
		allow negative curtailment, and the curtailment function may result in \
		negative numbers for some values of FP usage between 0% and 100%.  (3) If \
		the fraction of flexibility points used is between 0% and 100%, we apply \
		the curtailment function directly.  However, if the FP use is over 100%, \
		we always allow a minimum amount of dispatch- the amount that would be \
		allowed by the available FP, given by the term 1-ZIDZ(1/fraction of FP \
		used).  This is because the curtailment function is typically second- or \
		third-order and would result in unrealistically high curtailment at very \
		high multiples of available FP use if it were uncapped.

	~	Here is the purpose for each check in this variable.  (1) If the fraction \
		of flexibility points used last year is zero, then we likely are dealing \
		with one of the electricity sources that doesn't require flexibility \
		points, so we shouldn't curtail it.  (2) We use a MAX(0) because we cannot \
		allow negative curtailment, and the curtailment function may result in \
		negative numbers for some values of FP usage between 0% and 100%.  (3) If \
		the fraction of flexibility points used is between 0% and 100%, we apply \
		the curtailment function directly.  However, if the FP use is over 100%, \
		we always allow a minimum amount of dispatch- the amount that would be \
		allowed by the available FP, given by the term 1-ZIDZ(1/fraction of FP \
		used).  This is because the curtailment function is typically second- or \
		third-order and would result in unrealistically high curtailment at very \
		high multiples of available FP use if it were uncapped.

		example, natural gas plants built during the model run may be more and \
		more efficient if they are built in later and later years.  The properties \
		of the average natural gas plant built during the model run define the \
		properties of the "newly built" quality level for natural gas plants.  \
		This may be a weighted average of different underlying technologies, like \
		combined cycle, combustion turbine, etc.  This may have the effect of \
		overstating the performance of plants built early in the model run and \
		understating the performance of plants built late in the model run, but it \
		is more feasible from a model standpoint than tracking each annual cohort \
		of power plants individually (with its own set of values for each input \
		variable that defines its properties).

LDVs Feebate Rate=
	0 {passenger LDVs, except battery electric passenger LDVs}
	~	Dmnl [0,1]
	~	The feebate is set as a fraction of the global best practice feebate rate.  The \
		global best practice feebate rate is $2000 per (hundredth gal/mile), which \
		equates to a $2000 fee on an LDV that gets 20 mpg if the pivot point is 25 \
		mpg.  (To see this: 20 mpg is 0.04 gpm.  25 mpg is 0.05 gpm.  The \
		difference is -.01 gpm.  So in order to levy a $2000 fee on the 20 mpg car \
		when the pivot point is 25 mpg, we need a rate of $2000/.01 gpm.)  The \
		feebate rate is designated in gpm rather than mpg because this provides \
		the same monetary incentive to save a gallon of fuel for all LDVs, despite \
		their different efficiencies.  That is, given a fixed number of miles \
		driven, reducing gpm by 0.01 will save the same quantity of fuel for any \
		car.  Given a fixed number of miles driven, increasing mpg by 0.01 will \
		save different amounts of fuel in different cars, depending on their \
		starting efficiencies.
		
		We're assuming the pivot point is adjusted to always maintain revenue \
		neutrality (no net cost to government or consumers).  This policy lever \
		only applies to passenger LDVs due to a lack of data on feebate effects on \
		other vehicle types.  The policy does not increase the efficiency of \
		battery electric LDVs, as it is assumed that they are already sufficiently \
		fuel-efficient to receive any potential benefits of the feebate, so the \
		feebate would not incentivize further fuel efficiency improvements in this \
		type of LDV.

	~	Improvement in efficiency of components selected by consumers due to \
		improved labeling.  The labeling influences consumers who are buying \
		appliances of all Quality levels, so it's represented as a simple \
		percentage increase in the efficiency of components sold (at all quality \
		levels).  (If Quality Levels are defined based on particular efficiency \
		thresholds, this may mean the number of square feet served by components \
		of a given quality level will not be accurate, but the end result in terms \
		of energy use will still be accurate.  It's just a question of the meaning \
		of the labels we give to each Quality level.)

The LCFS calculation (and policy lever setting) refer only to the fuel used by regulated vehicle types (as specified by the model adapter in an input variable), after adjustment for the efficiency of use of electricity.  Hence, we calculate the various LCFS metrics here, as the ratio of carbon free energy to all energy that meets these two conditions.

Carbon Free Energy (CFE) refers to the decarbonized portion of the energy from natural gas and biofuels (relative to the reference fuels gasoline or diesel) and all electricity used as a transport fuel (irrespective of how the electricity was produced).

SoCDTtiNTY values for each vehicle/cargo type combination should typically be found via calibration.  After all other Transportation Sector data are in place, adjust the values of SoCDTtiNTY so as to eliminate abrupt changes in the variable "Retiring Vehicles" at the years corresponding to vehicle lifetimes.

We estimate start year fuel use (that is, one year before the first simulated year) by calculating it using data from the first simulated year.  This saves us the burden of calculating it in Excel and providing it as input data, and it prevents discontinuities as the model switches over from the provided value to a value calculated from the properties of the fleet.

To calibrate a vehicle type with a lifetime longer than the model run, such as rail, temporarily extend the model run by changing FINAL TIME to a farther-out value, such as 2060.  Perform the calibration, then restore FINAL TIME to its former value (2050).

Separately-regulated pollutants are non-CO2 combustion byproducts whose emissions are limited by law, such as a limit on NOx emissions per kilometer.  Improving fuel efficiency causes less fuel to be burned per kilometer, but it may not reduce emissions of NOx per kilometer.  Vehicle manufacturers design vehicles to meet fuel economy and conventional pollutant standards separately and may narrowly comply with each standard.  So, if fuel economy improves, the vehicle manufacturer may allow more NOx to be emitted per gram of gasoline burned, to keep the NOx rate per kilometer just under the standard.  We assume that separately-regulated pollutants are unaffected by changes in fuel economy, while other pollutants increase or decrease in proportion to changes in fuel economy.

All changes in revenue and expenditures here should be due to changes in domestic vehicles.  Changes in revenue or expenditure from selling vehicles for export is handled in the Industry sector, where vehicle suppliers are lumped into the "other industries" category.  For this reason, FoVObE should assign no vehicles to Foreign Entities.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

A "flexibility point" is a quantity of flexibility on the grid (provided by any combination of dispatchable generation, storage, and demand response) that enables the grid to support BOTH one MW of wind and one MW of solar.  We allow each flexibility point to support both generation types because wind and solar tend to be in need of support/backup at different times of the day and so can use the same flexibility resources.

The RPS ensures enough potential electricity output from RPS-qualifying sources is available.  The RPS does not explicitly affect dispatch, because the contract-based dispatch ought to take priority (and if high enough, is allowed to violate the RPS), and thereafter, the renewables ought to be dispatched first under least cost dispatch anyway, due to their low marginal cost

Policy-mandated new capacity is not subject to the build limits, but any capacity built under this policy does subtract from the amount that can be built apart from this policy (to a minimum of zero).

Electricity suppliers approach whichever future-year RPS target produces the highest slope in the current year, so as to minimize the slope of increases in future years.  (This method produces the lowest maximum slope, minimizing the shock to electricity producers.)

If all such slopes are negative (i.e. all future RPS targets are below the surviving RPS-qualifying percentage), the minimum RPS-qualifying percentage sought will drop over time, but this will not matter, as no significant amount of RPS-qualifying resources are likely to retire during the model run.

All support services (demand response, grid batteries, electric vehicles, and transmission capacity across the modeled region border) that can support the grid in one part of the modeled region may not be able to support the grid in a different part of the modeled region, subject to transmission constraints.  Hence, the available peak reduction services from all of these resources are limited by the transmission connectivity coefficient.

When determining the share of demand that can be met from surviving RPS-qualifying sources, we use the surviving sources' expected electricity output, which is based on their expected capacity factors.  We can't use their actual output this year because dispatch calculations are handled later in the calculation flow.  If the model thinks the RPS is satisfied but is not dispatching enough RPS-qualifying sources to meet the RPS, either adjust the expected capacity factors of RPS-qualifying sources, or adjust the dispatch settings (such as eliminating guaranteed dispatch for fossil plants that may crowd out RE).

Decommissioning costs for power plants are calculated (see the Electricity Supply - Cash Flow tab), but they are intentionally excluded from the calculation that determines what plant types to build, reflecting the fact that real-world utilities disregard these decades-distant, end-of-life costs when choosing what new plant types to build.

We calculate potential capacity retirements based on whether the dispatch cost of those plant types rises relative to the mean, relative to the BAU case.  This causes retirements of technologies like coal or natural gas as the mean cost of production declines, as more renewables come onto the system.

We disallow early economic retirement of technologies whose cost is below the average in the current year, even if they are farther below the mean price in the BAU case than they are in the policy case.  (This prevents a situation where the mean declines because lots of cheap renewables go on the grid, causing cheap sources like solar or wind to retire because they are becoming less-cheap relative to the mean in the policy case than they were in the BAU case.)

We assume embedded (i.e. non-fuel) emissions are upstream energy-related CO2, and thus is not affected by the control levers governing whether the carbon tax applies to process emissions or non-CO2 gases.

All support services (demand response, grid batteries, electric vehicles, and transmission capacity across the modeled region border) that can support the grid in one part of the modeled region may not be able to support the grid in a different part of the modeled region, subject to transmission constraints.  Hence, the available peak reduction services from all of these resources are limited by the transmission connectivity coefficient.

In this case, electricity suppliers are paying other electricity suppliers, so we don't recognize cash flow changes by entity.  (Broken-out industries are not restricted to the modeled region's borders.)  We do add the Change in Amount Spend on Importing Electricity to the Change in Total Outlays and Change in Capital Labor and Fuel Expenditures metrics, however.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

Note that the "heating" building component refers to heating of air.  Water heaters are part of the "appliances" component in this model, as they are unaffected by the building envelope, whereas the "envelope" component influences the energy use of "heating" and "cooling and ventilation" components.

In order to compare the cost of running building components that serve the same buildings with the same fuel, we need to calculate a hypothetical energy use quantity in the BAU case, if the fuel shifting policy (and no other policy) had applied to that case.  Otherwise, we see large increases in cost per unit services for components using the target fuel (most commonly electricity) and large drops for other components, which is wrong, as it would be interpreting a fuel shift as fuel increases and decreases at the same service levels.

Although this variable is not used in calculations on this sheet, it is used in calculations on other sheets, and it relies on an input data file (BDEQ) used for another variable on this sheet, so this variable must be placed here.

Note that for greater accuracy, it would be necessary to know how many years early components are replaced due to retrofitting, then to subtract out the energy use of the replaced components BOTH from new and from retiring components energy use in that year, because the component isn't being replaced in that year anymore, as it was replaced earlier.  In practice, these subtractions largely cancel each other out, and it's hard to find data on the number of years early that components would be replaced, so we simplify by not including this interaction.

Exogenous GDP energy use adjustment is introduced after the correction factor to avoid throwing off the correction factor calculations.  It effectively reduces energy use but not the purchase of new building components, similar to the effect of price-demand feedbacks.

Since input BCEU data may not be perfectly in sync with input lifetime (CL) data, to make our calculated BAU case components energy use match the input data, we use a correction factor.  The correction factor is calculated in Vensim and should be small if your BCEU and CL data are accurate and well-aligned with each other.  Larger discrepencies between data in BCEU and CL will result in a larger correction factor.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

We prevent reductions in crude oil feedstock use when the demand reduction for NGPS industry products is due to reduced demand for natural gas (which doesn't use crude oil as a feedstock).  The one-year delay here both is needed to avoid circularity and aligns these calculations to the same year as the reduced production, where there is also a one-year delay.

When industrial production declines as a result of a policy package, this creates two types of first-order cash flows.  First, industry sells fewer goods, receiving less revenue.  Second, industry buys fewer inputs, so other entities receive less cash (and industry saves some).  This structure tracks both of these cash flows.

We only calculate cash flows for changes in non-energy inputs here, because changes in energy inputs (e.g. changes in fuel and electricity purchases by industries) are handled elsewhere on this sheet (under the header "Cash Flow Changes from Fuel Use and Taxes Affecting Fuel").

Cash flow changes from changes in energy sales are already handled in each demand sector (and on the Fuels page for changes in net fuel exports), so the change in cash flow due to changes in industrial outputs from energy supplying industries is not included (is zero) here, to avoid double counting.

For cash flow entities that have matching industry categories (two energy industries), we use EPS-calculated revenue (with a delay to avoid circularity) rather than taking revenue from input data.

Since energy industries' spending on nonenergy inputs doesn't affect their revenue (it affects the revenue of nonenergy industries), it is technically possible to avoid the need to introduce this delay.  Getting around Vensim's circularity checks would require excluding nonenergy industries from the subscript of the revenue total variable used here.  That could be done by constructing a second, duplicative total revenue calculation, only including the energy industries.  This would require a lot of additional, duplicative model structure across all sectors, which is not worthwhile, either in development time, or in its impacts on model understandability.  The one-timestep delay is the better solution in this case.

We adjust the fraction of non-energy inputs sold to the energy industries based on changes in production by those industries.  The fraction sold to the non-energy cash flow entities adjusts to compensate and keep the total share at 100%.

The portion of non-energy industries' revenue going to labor (e.g. payments to their workers), to taxes (e.g. sales taxes on their products and corporate and worker income taxes), and to foreign entities (e.g. if the non-energy goods were purchased from abroad rather than from a domestic company) are separated out after the change in nonenergy industry revenue has been totaled across sectors.  Taxes on fuel/energy and special policy lever-driven taxes (and subsidies) are handled here.

This avoids unrealistic, spiky results and also allows the associated policies to be treated in a way consistent with other land use sector policies (except improved forest management).

We must include a one-step delay before calculating costs and fuel use to power CCS, as electricity is one of the fuels that can power CCS (in the Industry sector), and this influences electricity demand, which influences "Electricity Sector Pollutant Emissions before CCS," used here to help calculate sequestration from electric sector generation types.  (Note that Vensim incorrectly fails to generate a "Simultaneous Equation" error in the Policy (non-BAU) version of this loop, but it is actually circular in both the BAU and non-BAU structures.)

Changes in crude exports due to changes in secondary production should not be apportioned into changes in crude production or crude imports, because the crude that was formerly being used to make secondary products is now being exported instead.  Therefore, we subtract out any change in crude exports due to changes in secondary production.

Revenue for fuel, equipment, or labor provided to the modeled region's sectors (transportation, electricity, buildings, industry, district heat, hydrogen, etc.) is not export revenue, as the sectors represent activitiy within the modeled region.  Changes in export revenue in the EPS only come from the industry sector (where more or fewer non-energy goods can be sold to foreign entities) and in the fuels sector (where more or fewer fuels and electricity can be exported).

Partitioning is used to separate out the share of revenue changes for nonenergy industries that go to foreign entities, to labor, and to government.  This is not done in the demand sectors, but done here, after adding revenue changes from all sectors, to avoid duplication of code in each sector.

"Requirements" variables refer to the number of jobs, amount of added value, or earnings in each industry that is required to produce a particular level of output by a particular industry.  If you have a known change in output level of a particular industry (e.g. caused by policy, elsewhere in the EPS), you can multiply this by a requirements variable to determine how many jobs, added value, or earnings were required (created) in order to provide that incremental output.

Here, we account for the economic activity generated by changes in spending by government and by households (labor and consumers).  If we had domestic policies that influenced foreign spending on non-fuel industrial goods, that change in spending would need to be factored in here also.

The "Domestic" version of the Leontief Inverse Matrix filters out spending spent on foreign goods/services insofar as respending and cash flows between ISIC codes.  It expects an input that is the direct change in output for domestic ISIC codes (that is, it won't reduce the direct changes in output it receives to eliminate a foreign share), so we must do that as a separate step here.  Conversely, the "Total" version of the Leontief Inverse Matrix does not filter respending flows and requires a total (not just domestic) change in output as its input.

For the demand sectors' feedback loops, we need to filter out the direct effects of the policies (which are already accounted for in those sectors) and calculate only the policies' indirect effects on demand.

In the demand sectors' energy demand feedback loops, we want to feed back in the percent change in demand caused by the indirect effects of the policy package (as the direct effects are already included in each of these sectors).

All the changes in government and household spending on this sheet will cause indirect effects (as the direct effects of policies on spending, like a government subsidy to utilities or an efficiency policy reducing the amount of fuel households buy, are already accounted for in the sectors.)

Changes in industries' cash flows coming into this sheet (from "Change in Cash Flow by Entity" for the energy industries and from "Change in Nonenergy Industry Cash Flow by ISIC Code" for non-energy industries) are direct results of the policy package, not indirect.  But changes in spending by one ISIC code causes indirect effects on other industries.

Therefore, we use a modified version of the Domestic Leontief Inverse Matrix that excludes direct (same-industry) impacts for the industry contribution to change in output, while using the standard Domestic Leontief Inverse Matrix for household and government spending.

We don't know what ISIC codes in foreign nations received the "foreign entities" cash flow changes, so we allocate it to foreign industries in the same proportions as cash flow changes are allocated to domestic industries by the industry sector (as the industry sector, not government or households, will be the most important buyer of foreign products).  This is very rough (in reality, domestic and foreign industries likely specialize in different products), but it's better than omitting the foreign entities' direct cash flow change entirely.

Our Input-Output table data are based on a single historical year - we don't have projected future time-series values for BAU jobs, value added, or EE compensation disaggregated by ISIC code.  Prior to this step, only the policy effects are time-series.  We produce time-series BAU values and policy case totals below, by apportioning time-series totals using the historical ISIC code percentage breakdowns.  This captures overall growth or shrinkage of the economy, and the relative differences in growth between employee compensation and number of employees, but it does not capture changes in the relative importance of different ISIC codes that occur over time in the BAU case.  If we obtain time-series jobs, value added, or employee compensation projections by ISIC code in the future, this would improve accuracy.

Carbon taxes are levied upstream on fuel sales, before it is known whether a unit of fuel will be burned with or without CCS.  So the government must pay CCS providers back for the tax they already paid (capitalized into the cost of their fuels).  Also, CCS providers might sell their CCS services on a market for credits.  So carbon tax rebates are distinct rebate payments (which we classify as subsidies), not a reduction in tax.

Whether or not policies are ENABLED, all changes in cash flows should sum to zero.  Up to about +/- $1 million variance (maybe more with some policy packages) is to be expected due to limitations on accuracy of floating point calculations in Vensim.

Whether or not policies are ENABLED, all changes in revenues and expenditures for non-energy industries should be identical to those values when divided by ISIC Code.  Up to about +/- $1 million variance (maybe more with some policy packages) is to be expected due to limitations on accuracy of floating point calculations in Vensim.
