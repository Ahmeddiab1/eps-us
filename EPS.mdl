	~	Except for the cement industry, all reductions of process emissions come \
		from the EPA source, which does not include process CO2 in its marginal \
		abatement cost curves.  The EPA source with marginal cost curves works in \
		lumped CO2e, not broken out by gas.  Accordingly, we assume process \
		emissions reductions are from gases in proportion to the amount those \
		gases contribute to each industry's total process emissions, excluding \
		CO2.  We separately added a CO2 marginal abatement curve for the cement \
		industry, so we do allow process emissions to come out of CO2 for this \
		specific industry.  (Iron and steel only has CO2 process emissions, but no \
		policy options mitigate them.  Nonetheless, we assign 1 to CO2 for iron \
		and steel, in case mitigation options in the model change in the future, \
		allowing some of iron and steel's process CO2 to be mitigated.)

		energy savings due to retrofitting, so we don't worry about this \

		"Potential Energy Use of Replaced Components that Would Have Naturally \
		Retired This Year") to be at the same efficiency level as the replacement \

		example, natural gas plants built during the model run may be more and \
		more efficient if they are built in later and later years.  The properties \
		of the average natural gas plant built during the model run define the \
		properties of the "newly built" quality level for natural gas plants.  \
		This may be a weighted average of different underlying technologies, like \
		combined cycle, combustion turbine, etc.  This may have the effect of \
		overstating the performance of plants built early in the model run and \
		understating the performance of plants built late in the model run, but it \
		is more feasible from a model standpoint than tracking each annual cohort \
		of power plants individually (with its own set of values for each input \
		variable that defines its properties).

		by -0.1%.
	|

LDVs Feebate Rate=
	0 {LDVs}
	~	$/(hundredth gal/mile) [0,1940]
	~	At first glance, a feebate rate of $500/.01 gpm may sound very large.  However, this \
		feebate rate equates to a $500 fee on an LDV that gets 20 mpg if the pivot \
		point is 25 mpg.  (To see this: 20 mpg is 0.04 gpm.  25 mpg is 0.05 gpm.  \
		The difference is -.01 gpm.  So in order to levy a $500 fee on the 20 mpg \
		car when the pivot point is 25 mpg, we need a rate of $500/.01 gpm.)  The \
		feebate rate is designated in gpm rather than mpg because this provides \
		the same monetary incentive to save a gallon of fuel for all LDVs, despite \
		their different efficiencies.  That is, given a fixed number of miles \
		driven, reducing gpm by 0.01 will save the same quantity of fuel for any \
		car.  Given a fixed number of miles driven, increasing mpg by 0.01 will \
		save different amounts of fuel in different cars, depending on their \
		starting efficiencies.
		
		We're assuming the pivot point is adjusted to always maintain revenue \
		neutrality (no net cost to government or consumers).  This policy lever \
		only applies to LDVs due to a lack of data on feebate effects on other \
		vehicle types.

Fraction of TDM Package Implemented=
	0
	~	Dmnl [0,1]
	~	The Transportation Demand Management policy package reflects the International \
		Energy Agency (IEA)'s "BLUE Shifts" scenario for year 2050 (source \
		information below).  This package includes measures such as land-use \
		planning, promoting telework and information-based travel substitutes, \
		parking supply and pricing policies, roadway/congestion pricing, improving \
		bus transit, and encouraging non-motorized transit such as biking and \
		walking.  The IEA indicates that while they modeled year 2050, nearly the \
		same results could be achieved by 2030 with rapid implementation of these \
		policies, so we use the BLUE Shifts scenario to represent the maximum \
		potential for TDM intervention by this model's end year (e.g. with this \
		variable set to 1).  We assume the policy phases in linearly across the \
		model run.  Source:

We choose to track a lumped fuel economy (in energy units) across the different fuel types when tracking the fleet, then divide it up by fuel type at the end.  We do it this way for several reasons.

The Transportation section of the model uses the unit "thing" in a number of places.  When the "Cargo Type" subscript has the value "passenger," a thing is a passenger.  When the "Cargo Type" subscript has the value "freight," a thing is a freight ton.

(1) We have BAU future projections of fleetwide fuel use by fuel type, but not for vehicles sold in any given year.  We would need this (or an ALLOCATE function with pricing assumptions, etc.) to allocate new Cargo Dist Transported among fuel types.  This is further complicated by the fact that some vehicles are not locked into a fuel type at time of purchase but can use varying amounts of petroleum or biofuels.

(3) We would need BAU New Vehicle Fuel Economy data disaggregated by fuel type (or in the case of LDVs and HDVs, fuel standard data disaggregated by fuel type), as well as Historical Fuel Economy (or Energy Intensity) data disaggregated by fuel type.  These are not available, and an assumption likely introduces at least as much inaccuracy as the current approach.

New Vehicle Fuel Economy (tracked in lumped energy units) is based on the most typical fuel type or mix for each vehicle type (from the EIA source data or the units in which LDV fuel economy standards are written).  Electricity has much greater efficiency in BTU per unit cargo*dist, so we need to adjust the fuel usage.

Generally, it should also be used to guarantee dispatch of natural gas peaker and petroleum-fired power plants, which typically dispatch at their expected capacity factors in order to support the electric grid, not because the cost of their electricity is competitive in a least-cost dispatch system.

A "flexibility point" is a quantity of flexibility on the grid (provided by any combination of dispatchable generation, storage, and demand response) that enables the grid to support BOTH one MW of wind and one MW of solar.  We allow each flexibility point to support both generation types because wind and solar tend to be in need of support/backup at different times of the day and so can use the same flexibility resources.

Capacity constructed during the model run does not retire during the model run (unless forced to do so by the Early Retirement Policy or high cost, if all older generation has already retired) because the model run period (18 years) is shorter than the lifetime of the shortest-lived generation types (30 years).

The RPS ensures enough potential electricity output from RPS-qualifying sources is available.  The RPS does not explicitly affect dispatch, because the contract-based dispatch ought to take priority (and if high enough, is allowed to violate the RPS), and thereafter, the renewables ought to be dispatched first under least cost dispatch anyway, due to their low marginal cost

Policy-mandated new capacity is not subject to the build limits, but any capacity built under this policy does subtract from the amount that can be built apart from this policy (to a minimum of zero).

Electricity suppliers approach whichever future-year RPS target produces the highest slope in the current year, so as to minimize the slope of increases in future years.  (This method produces the lowest maximum slope, minimizing the shock to electricity producers.)

If all such slopes are negative (i.e. all future RPS targets are below the surviving RPS-qualifying percentage), the minimum RPS-qualifying percentage sought will drop over time, but this will not matter, as no significant amount of RPS-qualifying resources are likely to retire during the model run.

This page calculates changes in cash flows due to spending by the electricity sector, including on constructing new generation, buying fuel, OM, building transmission, etc.  It also calculates changes in electricity prices, for use on the "Fuels" sheet.  This sheet does not calculate cash flow impacts of changes in electricity sales, because those are handled on the cash flow pages of the various electricity-demanding sectors.

In this case, electricity suppliers are paying other electricity suppliers, so we don't recognize cash flow changes by entity.  (Broken-out industries are not restricted to the modeled region's borders.)  We do add the Change in Amount Spend on Importing Electricity to the Change in Total Outlays and Change in Capital Labor and Fuel Expenditures metrics, however.

We track cumulative energy difference relative to BAU, rather than tracking cumulative energy use (in the policy case), because this enables us to avoid making an assumption about the retirement rate of preexisting components at model start here.  (We still use such an assumption to help us estimate the fraction of component energy use that is new each year.)

Note that the "heating" building component refers to heating of air.  Water heaters are part of the "appliances" component in this model, as they are unaffected by the building envelope, whereas the "envelope" component influences the energy use of "heating" and "cooling and ventilation" components.

We add to "BAU New Components Energy Use" a quantity to represent the components that are purchased to replace the ones discarded due to the retrofitting policy.  We must subtract out the energy that represents components that in the BAU dataset are replacing ones that actually were replaced earlier due to the retrofitting policy, because their replacements were already factored in.

In order to compare the cost of running building components that serve the same buildings with the same fuel, we need to calculate a hypothetical energy use quantity in the BAU case, if the electrification policy (and no other policy) had applied to that case.  Otherwise, we see large increases in cost per unit services for electricity-powered components and large drops for other components, which is wrong, as it would be interpreting a fuel shift as fuel increases and decreases at the same service levels

We must convert to fuel use, not keep these as percent changes in fuel use, because if we use percent changes, (1) coal conversion doesn't work if a recipient fuel type for an industry is zero in the BAU case, and (2) we have trouble summing across policies in the Industrial Fuel Use variable.

We must separate the fuel used for CCS by sector into two variables (rather than using the CCS Sectors subscript) because they use fuel types that are in different subscripts (Electricity Source and Industrial Fuel), and Vensim won't allow you to use different subscripts in different equations within the same variable.

We do not retire any CCS equipment during the model run, because CCS equipment is relatively new and is long-lived (25-40 years).  We include this CCS equipment lifetime input variable in case we want to extend the length of the model run in the future and retiring CCS becomes relevant.

Except for electricity, BAU costs in this input variable should incorporate both taxes and BAU subsidies (many of which are upstream, such as those pertaining to drilling or mining, and are certainly incorporated in reported fuel prices).  For electricity, only taxes should be incorporated, as BAU subsidies paid to electricity producers are handled elsewhere on this sheet.

We estimate the effect of user-set policies collectively on the economy-wide emissions intensity here.  We use regular rather than "after GDP Adjustment" total to avoid the need for a SIMULTANEOUS directive, which works here but is fragile to changes in input data and model structure.  It makes little difference to the numerical results.

We generally don't use the "after GDP adjustment" versions of emissions variables, because the GDP adjustment only accounts for changes in energy prices, not the whole range of impacts the policies might have on GDP.  We mostly include this structure in case of future model extensions that may refine the Change in GDP calculation, making the "after GDP Adjustment" variables more meaningful.
