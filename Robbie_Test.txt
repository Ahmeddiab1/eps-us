Campaigns Modeling To-Do List
--------COMPLETED----------
-Re-run China scenario with updated carbon cap
-USA Components
	->RES
	->CO2 on elec/transport
-ZEV mandate policy
	
-EU Vehicles
-Bugs addressed
-->For the RES policy, when running in GCAM-USA there are some states that don't have 100% of the technologies, but the command is building those into the .XML file, causing it to throw an error. Is there a way to prevent it from building out the plant data for states that don't have certain techs?

	



--------STILL TO DO---------
-EU Vehicles
-->price too high for HDV >32t; try lower value
-->HDVs work, but value can't be higher than share-weight, so need to figure out how to change share-weights in scenario and couple with policy. Also appears to be some issue with the math done for the coefficients for certain techs. Should reset on these.
-USA Governors
-->efficiency
-->ZEV policy
-Get Rich to address some bugs
	1) Can't get the building efficiency template to work correctly. Getting a namespace error. [screen share]
	2) On setting interpolation function, need to be able to add an interpolation function if one doesn't already exist. For example, for vehicles, the interpolation functions at the stubTechnology level are set in the global tech database, but we want to add and customize at the regional level. [share this]
	3) ZEV Mandate policy
	4) Fix building electrificaiton policy
	5) Move to GCAM v5.2.0
